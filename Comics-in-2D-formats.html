          </span>: The comic title is Roots and Routes into Academia: composite stories with and by Russell Group Academics of Working-Class Heritage<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Comic image</span>: An image of an electronic tablet with two email messages. The first one at the top of the page is from Jack, who is a student, to their teacher, Penny. The second email, which is below Jack’s, is Penny’s reply to Jack. At either side of the tablet there is a picture of Jack and a picture of Penny’s faces.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Text</span>: Jack’s email reads, “Dear Penny, I’ve attached my research proposal. I’m interested in issues around social class and education. Your lecture sparked some ideas for me, but some of the case studies of working-class culture and heritage seemed quite negative, and I think a more positive view is needed. Penny’s reply reads, “Dear Jack, thanks for your feedback – let’s talk about this in our first meeting …”<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Panel 2</span>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Comic image</span>: Penny is sitting at her office desk beside a window which has a tree outside it. Jack is opening Penny’s door and sticking his head around it into Penny’s office.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Text</span>: Jack says, “Hi, I’m Jack. I’m here for my dissertation meeting. Penny replies, “Hi Jack. Come on in. Thanks for sending your dissertation proposal. Your ideas sound really interesting.”<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Panel 3</span>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Comic image</span>: Jack and Penny are sitting facing one another in conversation. They are sitting in front of a bookshelf full of books. Behind Jack there is a poster for the British band, Oasis.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Text</span>: Jack says, “I really enjoyed your social justice module last term. But that lecture on working-class communities being deprived rubbed me up the wrong way.” Penny replies, “Oh, okay, why was that?” Jack replies to Penny, “White middle-class academics making judgements about a community I come from and ones like it. It’s not all bad. I really enjoy crossing the border to go home – we have our own ideas on social justice and politics which are just as valid!” Penny says to Jack, “Oh, sorry it came across that way. Jack - wasn’t intended! Crossing the border? Where’s home?” Jack replies, “Northern Ireland.”<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Text</span>: Penny says, “It’s interesting that you mention crossing borders. Have you heard of a novel called Border Country? It’s by an academic called Raymond Williams.” Jack replies, “No, but I bet it’s by another middle-class academic talking about us as victims, right?” Penny says, “No, quite the opposite, actually! Here, you can borrow my copy. I think you might like it. It helped me navigate this academic world we’re part of.”<br>

Jack is pointing to the bookshelf. Behind Jack there is a poster for the British band, Oasis. There is also a vinyl LP on the wall which looks like a silver disc. Penny is showing Jack the non-academic half of the bookshelf. Jack is holding a blue book in his hand.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Text</span>: Jack says, “Thanks! So, you’re working-class then? How can you be, doing your job? I mean look at all these books.” Penny replies, Yeah, that’s my academic book wall. But this side is my non-academic wall. Two sides of the border, I guess! I like being reminded of home.” Jack replies, surprised, “Cool, I wouldn’t have guessed you listened to Oasis!” Penny replies, “Yeah, a favourite through my undergrad studies. So, a plan for our next meeting.”<br>

Jack is in a room in his family home, standing in front of a wall with some of his achievements, which include two medals and a certificate. There is also a picture of a group of people.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Text</span>: Penny says to Jack, “Hi Jack, how’s your reading going? Getting on with your reading?” Jack replies, “Good thanks. And yeah, had lots of time to read when travelling – the border crossing we talked about! Don’t mind my background – the wall that is. My Mum loves showing off all of my achievements, ha, ha.” Penny smiles and says, “I get what you mean. My Mum likes to ask me about my lectures loudly in public so everyone knows what I do.”<br>

There is also a picture of a group of people.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Text</span>: Jack says to Penny, “Oh yeah, my Mum does that too! My mates are always making fun of me for studying at a posh London university but I get laughed at for saying a French philosopher’s name wrong – you can’t win.” Penny replies, “Those culture clash moments! They can make you feel like you don’t fit in back at home or at university.” Jack says, “Especially as I don’t really have time to take part in the university culture. I work in a pub and try to fit my studies in. When I have free time, I spend it reading.” Penny replies, “Yeah, I think I still have my McDonald’s uniform from when I was a student. I guess it’s kind of like living on the border, in a liminal space.”<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Text</span>: Penny asks Jack, “How’s the literature review going?”. Jack replies, “Yeah, really good. I should think I’m all set. I should have a draft for you by next week. I’ve been thinking, how did you get to do a PhD?” Penny answers, “There are many different routes in. I’m actually working on a project about stories of working-class academics. We’re producing comics and other stories of our experiences. All of their routes are different and definitely not linear.”<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Text</span>: Jack says, “I like the idea of researching and teaching – sounds like a cool job. I guess I’m not really sure what else you do, though” Penny replies, “Right, let me get my tools of the trade. It’s funny, my Mum and Dad’s tools of the trade were scissors for haircuts, and a carpenter’s toolbox. Mines a satchel for books and papers and an academic diary.”<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Text</span>: Jack says, “I don’t fancy carrying a satchel – no offence, but it’s not really my style!” Penny replies, “Ha, ha. No don’t worry. It’s not essential for the job! Years ago, one of my undergrad lecturers had an old battered satchel stuffed with books and papers. I think it kind of symbolises the real academic to me. Same goes for the academic diary.”
