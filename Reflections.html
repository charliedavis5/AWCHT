        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2"> When the eight participants in this project came together in
September 2021, none of us knew each other. While we all identified as being and becoming academics of working-class
heritage (WCH), we were quite a heterogeneous group. Five of us identified as
being female and three as being male. There were a range of ages stretching
from the 30s to the 50s. Geographically, we originated from an array of urban
and rural spaces across the four UK nations, and Eastern Europe. In terms of
ethnicity, everyone within this self-selecting group identified as white.&nbsp;<br><!--[if !supportAnnotations]--><!--[endif]-->
          <br>Most of our interactions and discussions were carried out
via Teams. However, on some occasions, different people within the groups met
outside of our virtual inquiry space. Some of the group came together for <a href="https://www.mmu.ac.uk/about-us/professional-services/uta/euro-sotl-22" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1" target="_blank">EuroSoTL&nbsp;</a>in Manchester in May 2022, where we <a href="https://utaresources.mmu.ac.uk/euro_sotl/Proceeding Papers.pdf?_gl=1*1ckecti*_ga*MTQ0OTY1MTE0OS4xNjY5ODg1NDEx*_ga_GM9BQBMQVH*MTY2OTg4NTQxMS4xLjAuMTY2OTg4NTQxMS42MC4wLjA." class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-2" target="_blank">presented our experiences</a>&nbsp;as a developing community of inquiry. Through our work, we
have highlighted that a key component for any groups such as this to work is
the need for trust, particularly when sharing intimate memories tinged with
pain, trauma and joy. Without the trust, approaches such as this one are less likely to be meaningful.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>At the conceptual heart of this project was a commitment to
create narrative encounters as a means of keeping meaning open and developing
new understandings (<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Narrative_Pedagogy/NJU2_-nAihEC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-3" target="_blank">Goodson and Gill, 2011</a>). The narrative encounter is an unsettling one as it asks
people to be attentive to how the stories of others shape their own stories and potentially tell them something different about others as well as themselves.
The notion of unsettling is synonymous with rupture that leads to complicating
actions needed for stories to move forward, maintaining the interest of the
listener or reader. With the intention of causing disequilibrium in the hope it
would lead to moments of interrogation, there was always the concern that this
process would cause emotional dissonance. Therefore, the ethical dimensions of
the study were constantly visible, acting as a reminder to care for each other
and our stories.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

which can evoke a range of emotional responses.&nbsp;At times, this work was emotionally discomforting as we
revisited happenings and places sometimes tinged with trauma. After the second story circle,
it became apparent that we needed to decompress and talk about the emotional
demands of sharing. Talking about how the study was affecting ways we
(re)interpreted and remembered stories required the sharing of vulnerabilities,
which wouldn’t have happened without an emerging sense of trust. We realised
that emotional work was a necessary component of the storytelling process.
Therefore, rather than resort to that most human of responses to resolve
ambiguity and ward off contradiction to find comfort (see <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Feeling_Power/vzLmbZC8sIEC?hl=en" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-5" target="_blank">Boler, 1999</a>), we
worked with emotional discomfort to create our stories.&nbsp;<br>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> From the outset of the project, we pursued the pedagogic
principle of co-production of knowledge. This situated the study within
participatory paradigms, with a particular emphasis on decision-making as a
shared act. This concept of participation was aligned with an aspirant notion
of collectivity leading to the creation of an exilic space were power was
distributed equally. However, the practicalities of an academic life, where
time is short and demands are multiple, meant that participants wanted
direction and guidance from the principal investigator (PI). While I, in my
role as PI, initially felt it undemocratic to take more of a directional role,
I came to the realisation that to not respond to what participants requested
was not in the spirit of a democratic participatory approach&nbsp;<br>(<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Participatory_Research_for_Health_and_So/YYF7DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0" target="_blank" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">Amba et al, 2018</a>). Therefore, I started to put deadlines in place, ensure there
were regular updates and maintain contact through progress meetings. The
experience illustrated how often idealistic interpretations of what
participatory looks like can be problematised by the situational complexities
of the research site. In this instance, the everyday demands of being a busy
academic necessitated more direction.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>The project illustrated that intersectional identity characteristics such
as gender, age, and ethnicity challenge the idea of
working-class identity as something homogenous and stable. In addition, this
work has highlighted the spatial nature of stories and how the people we share social
and cultural spaces with will influence the stories we create to represent who
we are becoming. As <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Ethical_Loneliness/iwRaCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0" target="_blank" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-2">Jill Stauffer (2015)</a>&nbsp;maintains, representations of self are, for good and bad,
intersubjectively formed in the company of other people. Therefore, in studies
such as this, meaning needs to be kept open through questioning to help us
remain vigilant to the danger of any one story becoming sacrosanct. This
requires co-operation, trust, compassion and care for each other.&nbsp;
